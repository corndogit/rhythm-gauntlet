# Rhythm Gauntlet

![logo](.github\images\logo.png)

A rhythm adventure game made for [Solo Dev Game Jam #4](https://itch.io/jam/solo-dev-game-jam-4).

Theme: **Two Button Controls**  
Dev time: **72 hours**

## Controls  

Time your inputs to the beat of the level music to do more damage and block attacks! 
Blocks will fail if they are not close enough on beat (blocking does not need to be on beat for blocking fireballs)

- Key Z: attack
- Key X: block

You can control the character on the main menu screen to get a feel for the timing!
